<h2 align="left">Why and how do you cope with studying medicine and software engineering ?</h2>
<p>Medicine and technology have become increasingly interconnected, with each field relying on the other to make advancements and improve patient outcomes. The use of technology in medicine has revolutionized the healthcare industry, allowing for better diagnosis, treatment, and management of patient care.

As medical technology continues to evolve, there is a growing need for healthcare professionals who possess skills in both medicine and technology. For example, medical students who have an understanding of software engineering and programming languages can use this knowledge to create software tools that analyze patient data more efficiently and accurately. They can also develop mobile health applications that can be used by patients to monitor their health and communicate with their healthcare providers.

Software engineers who possess knowledge of medical concepts and processes can create applications and tools that improve patient care and outcomes. They can develop electronic health records systems, which enable healthcare providers to access patient information from anywhere, allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Furthermore, the integration of technology in medicine has led to the creation of new medical devices such as telemedicine tools, wearable devices, and diagnostic imaging. These devices have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, making it more accessible and cost-effective.. </p>
